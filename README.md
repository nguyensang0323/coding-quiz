# Coding Quiz
A concise quiz for individuals to evaluate their basic knowledge of coding.
## Project Description
This coding application incorporated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user is first presented with a starter page that includes description and direction for the quiz. The user has 40 seconds to complete the quiz and the timer starts when the user presses "Begin Quiz" button. JavaScript was able to provide the following functions:
- Timer interval of 40 seconds that deducts by 1 second.
- Dynamically presenting the questions, answer choices, and correct options.
- Compare the user's selection with the correct answer choices.
- Deduct 3 seconds from total time whenever user gets a question incorrect.
- Display the message "Out of Time!" when time runs out.
## Future Improvements
Due to some constraints, a few Acceptance Criteria were not fulfilled for this application:
- The user's initials and score being recorded into local storage and being available to view.
- Allowing user to view their highscores.
- Remove highscore and enable user to retake the quiz.
